Linux Management
linux
Linux Management is the process of monitoring and managing Linux users and computers within a network remotely, from a central location. Enterprises today have shown a rapid growth in the usage of Linux and it is being widely accepted as an alternative to traditional operating systems because of the ease of installation and usage. Linux offers more flexibility to apply custom configurations and being an open source operating system is one of the main driving factors for its adoption.

One of the major task for an administrator is to manage all the computers within a network, which often consumes a lot of time and effort. Endpoint Central helps administrators increase their efficiency by automating all the desktop management activities and managing heterogeneous operating systems from a single console.
